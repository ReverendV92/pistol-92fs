# A Classic, Updated
An old one, but a good one. Modderfreak's M9 Beretta/92FS now updated & given a fair bit of TLC. This version also includes additional variants to choose from for personal preferences.

### Features & Changes from Original

* Improved materials & updated compiles
* Tritium Night Sights
* Bug fixes to old model & animations
* Custom weapon scripts
* Optimized World Model
* Split Valve & Zoid animations into stand-alone packages
* Suppressed option

None of this would've been possible without [the original compiled by modderfreak](https://gamebanana.com/mods/181199), so be sure to check that out.
